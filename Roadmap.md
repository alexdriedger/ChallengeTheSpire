Challenge the Spire is considered complete and active development has finished.
Updates to Challenge the Spire will still be pushed as new versions of Slay the Spire come out (e.g. new characters, dlc, etc.).


However, there is still some polish and other ideas that could be added to Challenge the Spire if someone wanted to contribute.
Challenge the Spire also has support for cross mod compatibility for other mods to add their own challenges.
